<p>An adjective is a word or set of words that modifies (i.e., describes) a noun or pronoun.</p>
<p>Adjectives may come before the word they modify.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<p>That is a cute puppy.</p>
<p>She likes a high school senior.</p>

<p>Adjectives may also follow the word they modify:</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<p>That puppy looks cute.</p>
<p>The technology is state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>An adverb is a word or set of words that modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.</p>

<p>Examples</p>
<p>He speaks slowly (modifies the verb speaks)</p>
<p>He is especially clever (modifies the adjective clever)</p>
<p>He speaks all too slowly (modifies the adverb slowly)</p>

<p>An adverb answers how, when, where, or to what extent-how often or how much (e.g., daily, completely).</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p>He speaks slowly (answers the question how)</p>
<p>He speaks very slowly (answers the question how slowly)</p>
